To do so  I set a variable that would turn the number into a string so that it could be compared. Then, I needed to return whether or not that variable was equal to itself backwards. Once that was done I created a while loop for x >= 100. Within this while loop I have a for loop that evaluates y in the range of (x,100,-1), it is stepping down 1 because I initially set my x and y variables to 999 so that it would not to unnecessary work of looping through every single number if it was able to find the largest two numbers multiplies by one another that would equal a palindrome. Within that for loop I have an if statement that calls my palendrome function (palendrome_num) and passes through the equation x * y. Then within that if statement I have set the variable pal = x * y. After that I need to have another if statement that will help determine whether or not the next palindrome I find is greater than one that I have already found. If so I need to replace my variable of max_pal with the newly found palindrome. Once it reaches a palindrome that is no longer greater than the max_pal it will stop the loop. I also included finding the x and y value that made up the palindrome just to see what they were. Once that was done I printed out the statment that showed the max palindrome along with the x and y that produced that. "

    "    In order to find the sum of all prime numbers less than 2,000 I first needed to set a variable that would be able to take in all of the prime numbers to sum them. I labeled this variable sum_prime_num. Then I needed to define what a prime number was. In order to do that I wrote a function, is_prime, containing a for loop, looping through the range of 2 to n number (starting at 2 because by definition 1 is not a prime number). Within that for loop I determine whether or not the number we are testing (n) mod i == 0, in otherwords the remainder of n divided by i is 0 and if so then the for loop should return False, because that means the number is not prime because a prime number is not divisable by anything other than 1 and itself and since n is at the end of our range it will never include that number, therefore it will never test whether or not it is divisible by itself. However, if this is not the case then it will return True, showing that the number is prime. I then created a for loop in order to loop through all numbers less than 2,000. Within that for loop I have an if statement that first passes through the is_prime function, trying to see whether or not the number is prime, and then if it passes that it will add i to the variable I originally created, sum_prime_num, and then continuously loop through, each time adding the newly found prime to the updated value of sum_prime_num."

In this challenge it wanted to include the number 100 though, so I had to set the range to 101. Instead of only trying to find if something was divisible by 15, I also needed to do that with 3 and 5. Also, rather than continously add these values, I wanted to print everything out. So, a simple if elif statement within the for loop that returned the word associated with either divisble by 15 (FizzBuzz), 5 (Buzz), or 3 (Fizz) if it was found that, that number would in fact give a remainder of 0. If it did not pass any of those 3 statements then it just needed to print out the number itself. "
